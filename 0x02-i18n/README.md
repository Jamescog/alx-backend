# i18n

i18n stands for "internationalization," which refers to the process of designing software applications to be easily adapted to different languages and regions without requiring any code changes. The purpose of i18n is to create software that can be used by people from different parts of the world who speak different languages, without having to create separate versions of the software for each language.

## Flask

Flask is a Python web framework that supports i18n through the use of the Flask-Babel extension. Flask-Babel provides a simple interface for managing translations and localizations in Flask applications.

This repository contains the projects that focuses on i18n using Flask-Babel extension
